# Codex Desktop Installer Contract

## 1. Scope / Trigger

The Codex desktop installer spans Rust domain/source/platform code, seven Tauri
commands, TypeScript query/hook/card consumers, and platform-specific
verification. The historical v1.0.0 requirements are in
`docs/fyagent/dev/v1-0.0/`. For the active v1.0.2 scope,
`docs/fyagent/dev/v1-0.2/` is authoritative where it changes a contract. This
specification preserves the executable cross-layer boundary so later work does
not reintroduce user-controlled installer inputs, drift the wire format, or
label a platform card with a version from another platform's release.

## 2. Signatures

The ordinary Tauri command surface is exactly:

    codex_desktop_get_local_status()
    codex_desktop_check_latest(force: bool)
    codex_desktop_get_job()
    codex_desktop_start_install(request: StartInstallRequest)
    codex_desktop_cancel_install(job_id: string)
    codex_desktop_launch()
    codex_desktop_open_log_directory()

StartInstallRequest serializes as:

    { "expectedReleaseId": "v1:<64 lowercase hex characters>" }

No ordinary command accepts a URL, path, hash, identity, installer scope, or
validation-bypass flag. The hidden Windows all-users experiment is a
pre-runtime headless boundary, never one of these commands.

The safe remote status exposed by `codex_desktop_check_latest` is:

    RemoteReleaseStatus {
        releaseId: string,
        displayVersion: string,
        platformVersion: PlatformVersion,
        expectedSize: number,
        checkedAt: string,
    }

For the active platform/architecture, `displayVersion` is the same
branch-validated release's UI label; `platformVersion` remains the authoritative
comparison value.

## 3. Contracts

### Source to service

- ReleaseSource may request only the fixed AgentsMirror manifest/checksum and
  platform short-link endpoints represented by TrustedDownloadEndpoint.
- Metadata URLs, redirect targets, delta URLs, and remote filesystem names
  never become a caller-controlled download target.
- The fixed manifest/checksum endpoints use the same manual redirect policy as
  package requests: at most five hops, HTTPS only, no user information, and
  no persisted final URL. This permits the current fixed endpoint's R2
  redirect without turning redirect metadata into a renderer capability.
- The release descriptor is valid only after manifest checksum, derived
  checksum, checksum-file, architecture, size, and platform-version checks
  agree.
- A platform card's `displayVersion` must come from the validated branch it can
  install: Windows uses that architecture's MSIX `version`; macOS uses the
  validated bundle short version. A manifest-wide aggregate version may
  describe another platform and must not be returned as the active Windows
  card's latest version.
- Windows derives the MSIX name from its validated package moniker. macOS
  derives the single safe .dmg name from the validated branch/derived checksum
  records; a missing or ambiguous match fails closed.

### Windows package inspection

- The bounded manifest preflight accepts classic ZIP and single-disk ZIP64.
  A ZIP64 locator must be adjacent to the classic EOCD, identify exactly one
  disk, and point to a fixed 56-byte ZIP64 EOCD with no extensible data. Any
  non-sentinel classic field must agree with the ZIP64 value, and the central
  directory must end exactly where the ZIP64 EOCD begins.
- Raw central-directory inspection remains mandatory before `ZipArchive`:
  every entry must start on disk zero, use a unique safe UTF-8 name, be
  unencrypted, point to a local header before the central directory, and fit
  the exact bounded entry count and directory size. Multi-disk metadata at the
  EOCD, locator, ZIP64 EOCD, or entry level fails closed.
- The parser bounds aggregate declared uncompressed size to 4 GiB but only
  decompresses the root `AppxManifest.xml`, which remains independently
  limited to 512 KiB. Increasing the aggregate declaration bound must never
  remove the manifest read bound or replace Windows PackageManager as the
  signature and package-trust authority.

### Windows interactive-user scope

- Ordinary Windows construction requires the immutable interactive-user
  context created by the pre-Tauri runtime proof. It contains the canonical
  user SID and matching process/Shell session IDs, is internal-only and
  redacted, and is never reconstructed from package metadata or renderer input.
- The only ordinary identity path is process token/session -> `GetShellWindow`
  -> Shell PID/session -> Shell token SID -> exact process/Shell SID comparison.
  Missing Shell, token/session failure, session mismatch, or SID mismatch is
  unavailable/fail-closed. `WTSQueryUserToken` is not an ordinary GUI proof.
- Every ordinary inventory call passes the frozen SID and `PackageTypes.Main`
  to `FindPackagesByUserSecurityIdWithPackageTypes`, the locked Rust binding
  for the explicit-user PackageManager overload. Zero/one/multiple trusted
  Stable Main records for that SID mean not installed, one selected install,
  and ambiguous failure. Packages for another SID and non-Main package types
  never enter the candidate set.
- Inventory, current-user deployment, post-install verification, runtime
  inspection/termination, and launch all accept the same frozen context and
  return or consume context-bound evidence. Each native side-effect boundary
  re-proves the current process/Shell identity; missing or changed context and
  package/process owner mismatch stop the remaining lifecycle.
- Launch re-enumerates the same-user trusted Stable Main and requires it to be
  exactly the selected application before invoking Explorer. Restart treats
  multiple same-user Stable packages as ambiguous instead of using version or
  scope ordering to guess one. Runtime process evidence also requires the
  process token SID to match the frozen context.
- The all-users stage/provision helper remains outside the ordinary package
  facade and retains its all-user staged-package query. Ordinary code has no
  fallback or capability that can call it.

### Rust to renderer

- Rust serializes camelCase DTO fields and snake_case tagged enum values where
  declared by serde.
- JobSnapshot is a complete authoritative snapshot. The renderer merges events
  by jobId and monotonic sequence; it does not implement installer state
  transitions itself.
- The renderer may format `completedBytes / totalBytes` as a byte pair only
  while the view state is `job_downloading`. Installation progress reuses those
  numeric DTO fields for platform-native progress units: Windows reports a
  `0..100 / 100` deployment ratio and macOS reports `0..3 / 3` installation
  steps. Download verification and installation states may still render the
  derived percentage or an indeterminate progress bar, but must not label their
  counters as bytes.
- Download speed is a renderer-only interval measurement derived from adjacent
  accepted snapshots for the same job, using increasing `completedBytes` and
  `updatedAt`. The first sample, a non-increasing byte/time delta, invalid input,
  a different job, missing progress, or leaving the `downloading`/`download`
  stage resets the displayed speed while retaining a valid current sample as
  the next baseline. Bind a measurement to its `jobId` and `sequence` so an
  effect-driven state update cannot briefly expose the previous snapshot's
  speed; append `/s` only for the download stage. Do not add this display-only
  value to the Rust or TypeScript wire DTO.
- The canonical fixture tests/fixtures/codexDesktopDtoContract.v1.json is
  produced-equivalent to Rust DTO serialization and parsed by the TypeScript
  contract test.

### Job lifecycle

- At most one job may occupy the installer slot.
- A cancellation request keeps that slot until the worker has stopped
  cancellable work and cleaned its temporary files; only then may the snapshot
  become cancelled.
- A settings-triggered application restart must call
  `CodexDesktopService::claim_restart()` before saving state, cleanup, or
  re-exec. `claim_restart()` and `JobStore::try_start()` share one mutex: only
  an empty or terminal slot may claim restart; a cancellable, cancellation-
  pending, installing, or post-install-verifying job returns
  `JOB_ALREADY_RUNNING` without being cancelled or replaced. A successful
  claim rejects later starts until process re-exec clears the in-memory state.
- The renderer's default Tauri capability must not grant
  `process:allow-restart`. Renderer-initiated restarts use the controlled
  `restart_app` command above, so no frontend path can bypass the restart
  claim while an installer job owns the slot. The narrower
  `process:allow-exit` may remain for established explicit quit paths, which
  must continue through the application exit guard; never replace it with
  `process:default`.
- Before an install, the service force-refreshes metadata and rejects a changed
  releaseId with METADATA_CHANGED; the renderer must refresh and require a
  separate new Install/Update action.
- After that refresh and before preflight/download, the service re-detects the
  trusted local Stable application. If its platform version is equal to or
  newer than the descriptor, it launches that verified application and finishes
  the job through the narrow launch-only success path. It must create no temp
  directory and perform no disk probe, download, package validation, or install.
- A terminal checksum mismatch first deletes the fixed local artifact, then
  force-refreshes metadata exactly once for classification: a changed releaseId
  becomes METADATA_CHANGED; an unchanged releaseId remains CHECKSUM_MISMATCH.
- `VerifiedPackage` retains the locked descriptor, not only a previously
  verified path. Immediately before each platform consumption, it must reopen
  the fixed artifact under its canonical UUID job directory, reject a non-
  regular/link/reparse/path-drift artifact, and recheck exact size and SHA-256
  against that descriptor. Windows deploy and macOS DMG attach must not run
  after this check fails; macOS validates the mounted Stable bundle against the
  same descriptor's exact platform version.
- macOS standard-directory scanning uses a tolerant identifier probe before
  Stable-only validation. A malformed, non-file, missing-identity, or
  parse-rejected unrelated bundle is skipped. A top-level `.app` symlink whose
  canonical target escapes `/Applications` or `~/Applications` is also skipped
  before reading its identifier, so an unrelated external alias cannot block
  local discovery;
  only an exact `com.openai.codex` probe enters the strict version, executable,
  architecture, Team, codesign, and Gatekeeper checks. Downloaded/mounted
  package discovery keeps the strict wrapper and rejects every escaped `.app`
  candidate. Directory-enumeration failure, a non-symlink local canonical-path
  escape, or a known Stable candidate's strict failure remains fail closed.

### Experimental all-users boundary

- All-users provisioning is a Windows-only pre-runtime headless mode; it is
  never added to the ordinary renderer IPC surface.
- The elevated child rebuilds the fixed UUID/job-file capability path and asks
  an injected `AllUsersJobControlReader` for at most 16 KiB of JSON. Generic
  code must not `metadata`, `canonicalize`, or reopen that parent-owned path.
- The native reader opens the control file once with
  `FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`, rejects a reparse leaf, verifies the final
  handle path is the expected fixed local drive and a regular file, then reads
  through that same handle. It never uses `fs::read(expected_job_path)`.
- The child independently force-refreshes its release anchor and binds it to
  the job before deployment. It writes no parent-temp result file; only a
  protected ProgramData copy that is rehashed/revalidated may reach Stage and
  Provision.

Diagnostics may contain only the structured, redacted fields of
InstallerErrorDto; never pass raw credential-bearing URLs, paths, cookies, or
installer command lines to the renderer.

## 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

### Good

The renderer observes release A, calls start_install with expectedReleaseId A,
and the service re-resolves A before it downloads through the fixed platform
endpoint. A complete snapshot event lets the renderer show progress.

If the manifest's aggregate version differs from the Windows artifact version,
the Windows card displays that artifact's version and compares the canonical
four-part MSIX tuple. It does not imply that a macOS release is installable on
Windows.

### Base

Metadata is unavailable while a verified local app exists. The service reports
the remote failure while the renderer retains the separate local Launch action.

### Bad

    // Wrong: turns a metadata response into a download capability.
    invoke("codex_desktop_start_install", {
      request: { expectedReleaseId, url, path, scope: "all_users" },
    });

The command DTO must reject the extra fields, and the renderer must never offer
such controls.

## 6. Tests Required

- Rust: source checksum/artifact-name derivation, release-ID vectors, job
  transition/sequence/cancellation races, restart-claim-versus-start race,
  default-capability rejection of an uncoordinated renderer process restart
  while retaining only the guarded exit capability,
  replacement-after-verification regression paths that prove Windows deployment
  and macOS attach are not reached,
  macOS malformed-unrelated-bundle scan regressions alongside known-Stable
  fail-closed fixtures, plus the policy split that skips an escaped top-level
  local `.app` symlink while strict mounted-package discovery rejects it,
  service metadata-drift and checksum-reanchor behavior, direct same/newer
  local-version launch-only behavior, platform fixture/fake tests, DTO fixture
  equality, and a fixture whose manifest-wide aggregate version differs from
  the Windows branch and proves `displayVersion` remains branch-specific.
  Windows manifest fixtures must also cover a valid single-disk ZIP64 footer,
  classic/ZIP64 metadata disagreement, missing or misplaced records, inserted
  data between the central directory and ZIP64 EOCD, entry-level non-zero disk
  start, bounded production-scale uncompressed declarations, the 4 GiB limit,
  and checked-sum overflow.
- TypeScript: import and parse tests/fixtures/codexDesktopDtoContract.v1.json;
  enumerate every frozen enum/tag branch and consume the complete snapshot.
  Component coverage must prove `job_downloading` retains percentage plus the
  formatted current/total byte pair and a finite speed after a second valid
  sample. Hook coverage must prove first/invalid/non-increasing samples and
  job/phase/progress resets cannot retain stale speed, while a later valid
  sample recovers from the new baseline. `job_installing` with non-null
  current/total/speed values renders the percentage without any byte or `/s`
  label.
- Integration: static audit that ordinary IPC has no all-users or custom-input
  surface, and each command remains registered exactly once.
- All-users: inject a bounded control reader; assert oversized JSON rejects
  before metadata/native adapters, generic code has no path reopen, and the
  Windows reader has a no-follow same-handle/final-path/fixed-drive audit.
- Platform acceptance: real Windows x64, Windows ARM64, Apple Silicon macOS,
  and mainland-network checks remain human-owned and are not replaced by these
  tests.
- Windows user scope: hermetic multi-SID fakes prove explicit SID/Main calls,
  other-user exclusion, same-user 0/1/multiple behavior, context receipt drift,
  owner drift, post-verify continuity, launch/restart revalidation, and zero
  ordinary calls into all-users capability. If a unique record becomes
  multiple during post-install or pre-launch revalidation, tests retain
  non-retryable `MULTIPLE_INSTALLATIONS` and prove launch is not called. A
  native smoke on both matching
  Windows architectures calls only the real explicit-SID/Main WinRT adapter,
  permits an empty result, and uses no Store/network/real Codex/multi-account
  dependency.

## 7. Wrong vs Correct

### Wrong

    // A fixed marketing filename breaks when the signed upstream DMG is renamed.
    let artifact_name = "Codex-mac-arm64.dmg";

### Correct

    // Select only the unique safe DMG whose checksum record agrees with the
    // validated macOS branch, then keep downloading through the fixed endpoint.
    let artifact_name = derive_macos_arm64_artifact_file_name(
        &manifest.derived.latest_checksums,
        artifact.sha256.as_deref(),
    )?;

The filename is data used to cross-check integrity metadata, not a path or
remote URL capability.

### Wrong

```rust
// A root aggregate can describe a different platform release.
display_version: manifest.codex_version.to_owned(),
```

### Correct

```rust
// The card can only label the version its active architecture can install.
display_version: validated_windows_artifact.version.to_owned(),
```

Keep update-state comparison on the canonical `platformVersion`, not on either
display string.

### Wrong

```rust
// Checking a parent-owned path and later reopening it leaves a TOCTOU window.
let metadata = std::fs::metadata(expected_job_path)?;
let bytes = std::fs::read(expected_job_path)?;
```

### Correct

```rust
// Native code verifies and consumes one no-follow handle; generic protocol
// code receives only the already-bounded byte vector.
let bytes = job_control_reader.read_job_control(expected_job_path, 16 * 1024)?;
```

Likewise, do not merely inspect the installer job before a delayed restart:
claim the shared job-store mutex first, so a new worker cannot start during the
response/re-exec window.

### Wrong

```tsx
// Installation counters are not necessarily byte counts.
const completedText = formatBytes(progress?.current);
const totalText = formatBytes(progress?.total);
```

### Correct

```tsx
// Only the download stage owns byte-labelled progress in the card.
const showDownloadBytes = state === "job_downloading";
const completedText = showDownloadBytes ? formatBytes(progress?.current) : null;
const totalText = showDownloadBytes ? formatBytes(progress?.total) : null;
```
