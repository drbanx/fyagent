# Backend Development Guidelines

This layer records executable backend contracts for the Rust/Tauri host. The
current modernization authority is `docs/fyagent/dev/v1-0.3.0/`, interpreted
with its 2026-08-08 execution overrides and real implementation evidence. Older
`docs/fyagent/dev/v1-0.*` packages are historical inputs: preserve their bodies
and do not let an older version, release, signing, or tooling statement override
the current contracts below. When a code contract changes, update its owning
code-spec and enforcing test; update a product document only when that document
is owned by the change.

## Pre-Development Checklist

Before changing Rust/Tauri host code:

1. Locate the owning contract below; do not add a second rule where an existing
   installer, version, security, release, or platform contract already owns it.
2. For a Tauri command, serialized DTO, event, or persisted-data change, also
   read the [Frontend Development Guidelines](../frontend/index.md) and its
   [Type Safety](../frontend/type-safety.md) boundary before changing either
   side.
3. For user files, credentials, deep links, process control, installers, or
   release artifacts, identify the validation/error case and the test that will
   prove it before editing implementation code.
4. Run local commands through the shared
   [Development Environment Contract](./development-environment.md); do not
   substitute a machine-global Node, Rust, or pnpm toolchain, and never select
   a non-host OS/architecture locally. Native compile/test entrypoints must use
   their guarded mise task (or the guarded `pnpm dev`/`pnpm build` alias), not
   the low-level `pnpm tauri` maintenance/Actions leaf.
5. Keep versioned product documents in their documented ownership boundary;
   record checkout-specific implementation contracts here rather than
   mechanically rewriting historical/reference packages.

## Quality Check

Run the **Tests Required** section of every contract affected by the change.
For ordinary Rust/Tauri changes, the baseline local checks are:

```bash
mise run rust:fmt:check
mise run rust:clippy
mise run rust:test
```

Add the applicable renderer, version, Windows, macOS, or release contract
checks rather than reporting an unrelated local command as platform or release
evidence. Canonical local native commands verify and pin the current host
OS/architecture; matching native Actions jobs own all non-host evidence. A
code-spec update that changes a contract must name its enforcing test;
successful local static checks never prove a native package, artifact
attestation, or remotely published Release.
